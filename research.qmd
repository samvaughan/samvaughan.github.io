## Integral Field Spectroscopy

Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) is a revolutionary technique for understanding what's going on within galaxies, combining the spatial resolution of taking an image with the information content of spectroscopy. The now-completed [SAMI galaxy survey](http://sami-survey.org/) and the forthcoming [Hector Galaxy Survey](https://hector.survey.org.au/) (for which I'm leading the target selection) use integral-field spectroscopy to study thousands of nearby galaxies, building up a census of our cosmic neighbours. I'm particularly interested in the chemical properties of the stars in these galaxies, and studying how a galaxy's cosmic history can influence its present-day properties.

## The Stellar Initial Mass function

The Initial Mass Function (IMF) describes the proportion of massive stars in a galaxy to those which are lighter than our sun. It's key for understanding a galaxy's lifecycle, and gives important clues to how the galaxy formed in the first place. During my PhD, I tried to measure the IMF within nearby galaxies by looking for the "fingerprints" of low-mass stars in the spectra of their integrated light. I was recently a co-investigator on an [accepted JWST proposal](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information.html?id=3507) to try and do this on some galaxies much, _much_ further away, so watch this space!

## Statistics and Software

I'm interested in learning new statistical techniques to make better sense of the large amounts of data astronomers produce. I also write open source software (mainly in `python`, but also in `R`) and experiment with machine learning tools and deep neural networks. I have developed a package to fit galaxy spectra with population models ([`PyStaff`](https://github.com/samvaughan/PyStaff)), written a pure python/numpy implementation of a deep neural network to classify hand-written numbers (MNIST) and collaborated on a project to create plausibly-sounding fake scientific titles using natural language processing tools.

## Observing

I've been lucky enough to travel to some amazing places during my career, with over 75 nights observing experience across the 3.9 metre Anglo-Australian Telescope, the 200-inch telescope at Palomar Observatory, California and the Very Large Telescope in the Atacama Desert, Chile.
