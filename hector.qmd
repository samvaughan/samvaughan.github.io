I've been very involed in the [Hector Galaxy Survey](https://hector.survey.org.au/), a $7m dollar Australian Research Council funded project to meausure the properties of 15,000 galaxies in the night sky. 

The code I've written has helped the survey create catalogues of targets to study, group these big catalogues into individual "tiles", and turn these tiles into the correct files the astronomers at the telescope need to actually carry out our observations. 

You can find the documentation I've written about these steps below:
