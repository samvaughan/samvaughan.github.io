I'm an [Astro3D](https://astro3d.org.au/) Postdoctoral Research Associate in Data Intensive Astronomy at [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/secure-planet/centres/research-centre-for-astronomy-astrophysics-and-astrophotonics) in Sydney. I work on studying the formation and evolution of galaxies. I was previously a postdoc at the University of Sydney, and I received my PhD from the University of Oxford in 2019.

You can find a list of my publications [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#search/q=orcid%3A0000-0003-2265-7727&sort=date+desc) and a recent CV [here](cv.pdf).
