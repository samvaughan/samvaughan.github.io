Astronomers get to travel a lot- it's a pretty important part of the job. I seem to have done better than most so far during my studies, however! I've been lucky enough to travel to Chile twice so far in order to visit the VLT at Paranal Observatory. Believe it or not, 'VLT' stands for the 'Very Large Telescope'...

The VLT is one of the most high-tech observatories in the world. It's located in the Atacama desert and is actually home to four main telescopes, along with a couple of smaller survey telescopes. Some of the most exciting astronomical discoveries of recent years have been made with observations taken here- and I was very excited to be able to visit.

There are many excellent photos and video tours of the VLT. I particularly like [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXJEVJey9Wz7-RJsHXFcCxicpICjjCWDA) by the DeepSkyVideos Youtube channel. There are views of the inside of each of the four telescopes,  and it also has a tour of the 'Resedencia', where astronomers and technicians stay whilst they visit Paranal. The Resedencia is actually famous in its own right, since it makes an appearance as the hideout in the Bond film 'Quantum of Solace'.


## Observing with KMOS

I was there to use the 'K-Band Multi Object Spectrograph', or KMOS. KMOS can take spectra of up to 24 objects at the same time in the near Infrared part of the spectrum, which astronomers call the K-Band. The targets were two clusters of galaxies located about six billion light years from Earth, at a redshift of around 0.5. Photons from these galaxies had been travelling for billions of years before they landed on the mirror of VLT telescope 1, travelled into the KMOS detectors and showed up on my computer screen- something that still blows my mind whenever I think about it!

We wanted to study the kinematics of the galaxies in these clusters by making two-dimensional maps of their gas velocities and velocity dispersions. I give a quick summary of how to measure *stellar* kinematics [here](http://samvaughan.github.io/science/2017/07/13/Galaxy_Kinematics.html), but the ideas are essentially the same.

KMOS can also tell us how quickly these galaxies are forming stars. There are a number of studies describing the rate of star formation at redshifts higher than one, and studying these intermediate redshift clusters is important to bridge the gap between those studies and the local universe we observe today. 

## A night at the telescope

So what does a night of observing at the VLT actually consist of?
