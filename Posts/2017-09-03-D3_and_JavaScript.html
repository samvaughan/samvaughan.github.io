<h1>D3 and Javascript</h1>
<h4>2017-09-03</h4>
<p>I was inspired by some of the really impressive visualisations <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">here</a> to dive in and 
learn some javascript and D3! I found <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch01.html">this</a> excellent book by Scott Murray to be really informative and useful (although written for a previous version of D3- there's an updated edition of
 the book, but I don't think it's open access). </p>
<p>Below is a simple graph with points that you can move and drag around. The code borrows very heavily from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42720488/d3-v4-drag-line-chart-with-x-and-y-axes">this</a>
stack overflow question/answer, and is also available on my github account <a href="https://github.com/samvaughan/samvaughan.github.io/blob/master/_posts/JS/drag_points.js">here</a>.</p>

<script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js">
</script>

<script src="JS/drag_points.js">
</script>

<p>Getting it embedded in the Jekyll markdown this site uses was also a bit challenging- but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22651346/how-to-embed-a-d3-js-example-to-the-jekyll-blog-post">this</a> 
stack overflow answer was very helpful. I went with the second method they mention- making a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag and creating an
SVG element inside that. </p>
<p>There's already lots of things I'd like to apply D3 to- so watch this space! </p>
